[The Pew Research Center global a survey about homosexuality last year](http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/). They asked the question "Should society accept homosexuality?"* I substracted the no's from the yes' to calculate what I call the acceptance rate.

I compared that acceptance rate to GDP per capita and found some interesting results. I'll let you make your own conclusions.

The chart was made in [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/mac/numbers/).

\* It is important to note that this is not a survey about particular gay rights like same sex marriage, it is simply asking whether we should accept homosexuality or not.
